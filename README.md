# MiniTaskManager

MiniTaskManager is a simple command-line application for Windows that demonstrates basic process management using C++ and Windows APIs. The project is designed to help you get hands-on experience with C++, CMake, and the Ninja build system.

## Features

- Lists running processes (Windows-specific)
- Displays memory usage information
- Modular code structure for easy extension

## Prerequisites

- Windows OS
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (version 3.8 or higher)
- [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/)
- C++20 compatible compiler (MSVC, MinGW, etc.)

## Building the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dadiya-Harsh/MiniTaskManager.git
```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
```bash
cd MiniTaskManager
```
3. **Generate build files with CMake and Ninja:**
```bash
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja
```
4. **Run the application:**
